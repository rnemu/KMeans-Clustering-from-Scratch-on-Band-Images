# KMeans Clustering from Scratch on Band Images

This repository contains an implementation of the KMeans clustering algorithm from scratch, applied to band images. The project is organized to facilitate easy access to data, code for annotation, and the main KMeans implementation.
## Overview
### KMeans Algorithm
The KMeans clustering algorithm is implemented from scratch in the `kmeans_band_image.ipynb` notebook. The steps include:

- Initialization of centroids
- Assignment of data points to the nearest centroid
- Update of centroids based on the mean of assigned points
- Iteration until convergence
## Repository Structure

- **Data/**: Contains band images used for clustering.
- **Code/**:
  - **kmeans_band_image.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook containing the implementation of the KMeans algorithm from scratch and its application on band images.
